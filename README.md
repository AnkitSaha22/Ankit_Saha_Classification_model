Steps to build the classification model:
Step 1: Load Tokenizer
Step 2: Load pre-trained model
Step 3: Creating Sample a subset of the training data which is equally distributed with the original data
Step 4: Creating Sample a subset of the test data which is equally distributed with the original data
Step 5: Creating Sample a subset of the test data which is differently distributed from the original data
Step 6: Tokenize training data
Step 7: Tokenize testing data 
Step 8: Define the training function\
Step 9: Train the model
Step 10: Evaluate the trained model
